## About the Project
In this project I had to use a dataset and create a visualization that users could easily use and understand and also draw their attention to want to use it.
It taught me a lot about how to understand my user and think about my target audience when making a project.
### Highlights
1. I felt like my design was very interactable and allowed the user to switch many things like the player and many different views
2. I liked the way my graph was more applicable to basketball than just an average bar graph
